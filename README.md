# simple-dictionary README

If you prepare dictionary files, this extension displays the meaning of the mouse-over word.

## How to use

1. Prepare dictionary files. The file format is tsv, `index<tab>meaning`.
2. Set `simple-dictionary.dictPaths`

If the mouse-over word is registered in your dictionaries, a pop-up appears with the meaning.
